# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns.
Build predictive models to classify churn vs. non-churn customers.
Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow

Data Preprocessing â€“ cleaning, encoding, and scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ visualizing churn trends.
Model Training â€“ Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Evaluation â€“ accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Insights â€“ identifying key drivers of churn.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Languages/Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

ðŸ”¹ Results

Achieved high accuracy and balanced precision-recall for churn prediction.
Feature importance analysis revealed key factors influencing churn.
